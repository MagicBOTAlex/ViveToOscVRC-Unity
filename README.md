# Info
The reason you would want to this is FTB with base stations + Quest 2 full hand tracking in VRChat.

### Semi-functional console-app based version (Only tracking position): https://github.com/MagicBOTAlex/ViveToOscVRC

# Features
[x] Sends data through OSC to VRChat. <br>
[x] Auto floor offset (Idk how good it is though)

# Problems
* No UI or any feedback

# How to build
1. Open Unity <br>
2. Wait for nuget packages to be installed. <br>
3. Start SteamVR <br>
4. Enter playmode

# TODO
* Code orginization. (I just wanted a prototype as fast as possible)
* UI/CLI. (Currently only able to change IP and port through the unity inspector)
